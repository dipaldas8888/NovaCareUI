    <h2 style="color:#22c55e; font-weight:900; margin-bottom:16px;">Fever in Infants: What Parents Should Know</h2>
    <p>Fever in babies is one of the most common reasons parents rush to the doctor. While most fevers are caused by mild infections, in certain cases, fever may indicate a more serious condition. Knowing the causes, symptoms, and red flags can help parents act at the right time.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#22c55e; font-weight:800; margin-top:24px;">Causes</h3>
    <p>Infants may develop fever due to several reasons, including viral infections (common cold, flu), bacterial infections (ear, urinary tract, pneumonia), and post-vaccination immune responses. Mild fever can also accompany teething, though high fever is unusual.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#22c55e; font-weight:800; margin-top:24px;">Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Besides elevated temperature, infants may show signs such as irritability, crying, poor feeding, lethargy, sweating, or shivering. Some babies may experience dehydration or seizures if the fever spikes suddenly.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#22c55e; font-weight:800; margin-top:24px;">When to See a Doctor</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fever above <strong>100.4°F (38°C)</strong> in babies younger than 3 months</li>
      <li>Fever lasting more than 3 days</li>
      <li>Persistent vomiting or refusal to feed</li>
      <li>Seizures or excessive sleepiness</li>

    />

    <h3 style="color:#22c55e; font-weight:800; margin-top:24px;">Management</h3>
    <p>Keep the baby hydrated with breast milk or formula. Use a digital thermometer for accurate readings. Light clothing and a lukewarm sponge bath may help lower temperature. Paracetamol may be given <em>only</em> under pediatric advice.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#22c55e; font-weight:900; margin-top:32px;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Most fevers are mild and resolve with care at home, but parents should monitor closely and seek medical advice when necessary. Timely action can prevent complications.</p>
